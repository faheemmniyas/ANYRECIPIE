        <h2>COOKING PLANNER</h2>
        
        <p>We understand far too well the struggles of cooking. After all, it’s not only cooking – there’s also writing the grocery list, driving to the store, buying your groceries, chopping and prepping, and then comes the cooking. That takes hours. And then the eating part only takes half an hour, after which follows the time to clean everything..

        Experiencing this every day is enough to make you abandon all ideas of a cozy homemade meal at a nicely set table like most movies portray. You’ll want to run straight into the arms of the closest restaurant or take-out chain to spare yourself from countless hours spent preparing one meal. However, we have a solution for you! And that is to meal plan. We’ll be honest up front and admit that with meal planning, you’ll still have to do the chopping and the cooking. But with meal planning, you’ll be able to eliminate the stress that comes with the above scenario and actually enjoy home-cooked meals.<br>
        <br>
        Meal planning helps you to save money, because you’ll know ahead of time what you’ll be cooking, and you’ll already have your grocery list ready to go. You’ll be able to plan meals around items that you already have at home, which means you won’t overspend on groceries, some of which will end up going bad and being tossed – the result of not following a list and buying too much. With meal planning, you buy what you need

       Knowing ahead of time what you’ll be cooking for the week will also save you from eating out and ordering take-out. American households average $3,000 per year eating out. Yikes! We’re sure you’d rather put that money somewhere else. This doesn’t only pertain to dinnertime. When you meal plan and make sure to include lunch leftovers, you’ll also save hundreds of dollars every month avoiding buying food near work</p>

             Around 40% of food is wasted in America and the average family throws away $2,200 worth of food every single year. We’re positive that you would rather have that 2 grand in your pocket than in the trash, which is where meal planning comes in. There’s nothing more annoying than opening your fridge and realizing that the tub of sour cream you bought is harboring mold. Or the bunch of chard that you had good intentions of eating is now a wilted pile of brown mush. By planning out all of the meals you will be cooking, you’ll ensure that no food gets left behind.
